            options: ["Radiation officer", "Chief radiologist", "Chief technologist", "Department manager"],
            correct: 0,
            explain: "The Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) is specifically responsible for implementing safety measures and ensuring regulatory guidelines are followed to protect patients and staff."

            correct: 1,
            explain: "A Phototimer (or Automatic Exposure Control/AEC) automatically terminates the exposure when a specific amount of radiation has reached the detector, ensuring consistent density regardless of patient thickness."

            correct: 2,
            explain: "For a lower abdomen CT, clearing the bowel is crucial to visualize structures. A laxative the day before and NPO (nothing by mouth) from midnight is the standard protocol to reduce bowel content/gas."

            correct: 0,
            explain: "Differential absorption is the difference between the x-rays absorbed photoelectrically and those transmitted to the image receptor. This difference creates the contrast (shades of gray) on the image."

            correct: 0,
            explain: "An erect position allows gravity to act on the kidneys. If a kidney drops more than 5cm (2 inches) when standing, it indicates nephroptosis (floating kidney)."

            correct: 2,
            explain: "Gadolinium contrast agents shorten the T1 relaxation time. Therefore, lesions taking up contrast appear bright (hyperintense) on T1-weighted images."

            correct: 3,
            explain: "Lymphocytes are the most radiosensitive blood cells. A dose of 0.25 Sv (25 rads) is sufficient to cause hematologic depression, specifically a decrease in lymphocyte count."

            correct: 3,
            explain: "Most positioning errors and motion artifacts—the leading causes of repeats—stem from the patient not fully understanding instructions due to poor communication."

            correct: 0,
            explain: "Spondylolisthesis is a bony condition (slippage of vertebrae). A Non-contrast CT (or plain radiograph) is excellent for visualizing bony alignment and fractures."

            options: ["4 ft", "5 ft", "8 ft", "12 ft"],
            correct: 2,
            explain: "Using the Inverse Square Law: To reduce intensity by a factor of 4 (20 divided by 5), you must double the distance. 4 feet x 2 = 8 feet."

            correct: 2,
            explain: "Elevated creatinine indicates impaired renal function. Injecting contrast could cause further damage (Contrast-Induced Nephropathy). You must consult the doctor before proceeding."

            correct: 0,
            explain: "Effective Dose (E) = Absorbed Dose (D) x Wr x Wt. E = 0.15 x 1 x 0.05 = 0.0075 Sv. This rounds to roughly 0.01 Sv."

            correct: 0,
            explain: "The first trimester (specifically organogenesis, weeks 2-10) is the most radiosensitive period because cells are rapidly dividing and differentiating."

            correct: 0,
            explain: "Aliasing (streaking) occurs when there is undersampling. Increasing scan time (to get more samples) or reducing pitch helps acquire sufficient data to resolve the artifact."
